# Python Fundamentals

This repository contains materials to help you learn the fundamentals of Python programming. In this README.md file, we'll cover the basics of data structures, syntax, and function definitions.

## Data Structures

Python supports various data structures, including:

- Lists: ordered collections of items that can be of different types
- Tuples: ordered collections of items that cannot be modified
- Dictionaries: unordered collections of key-value pairs
- Sets: unordered collections of unique items

## Syntax

Python has a clean and simple syntax that makes it easy to learn and read. Here are some basic syntax rules:

- Indentation: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code
- Comments: use the "#" symbol to add comments to your code
- Variables: use variables to store data values
- Operators: use operators to perform operations on data values

## Function Definitions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Here's an example of how to define a function in Python:

```python
def my_function(parameter1, parameter2):
    # code block
    return result
```

- The `def` keyword is used to define a function
- `my_function` is the name of the function
- `parameter1` and `parameter2` are input parameters that the function can use
- The code block contains the instructions that the function executes
- `return` is used to return a value from the function
